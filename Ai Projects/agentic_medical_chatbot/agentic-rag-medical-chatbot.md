# Agentic RAG-Based Medical Chatbot (GenAI)

## Project Overview
An intelligent medical chatbot system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic AI capabilities to provide accurate medical information and assistance. This system combines the power of large language models with specialized medical knowledge bases to deliver contextually relevant and medically accurate responses. The agentic nature allows the system to autonomously decide when to retrieve additional information, when to ask clarifying questions, and when to escalate to human medical professionals.

The chatbot operates as a multi-agent system where different specialized agents handle various aspects of medical consultation, including symptom analysis, medication information, treatment recommendations, and emergency assessment. Each agent is equipped with RAG capabilities to access the most current and relevant medical literature, clinical guidelines, and drug databases. The system maintains conversation context across multiple interactions and can adapt its response style based on the user's medical literacy level and urgency of the situation.

## RAG Architecture Overview

### Enhanced Retrieval Strategies
The system implements a sophisticated multi-strategy retrieval approach that combines vector similarity search, keyword-based retrieval (BM25), and ensemble methods to ensure comprehensive information retrieval. The RAG pipeline includes intelligent caching mechanisms to improve response times and reduce API costs while maintaining high relevance scores through medical domain-specific relevance calculations.

The knowledge base is structured hierarchically with specialized sources including PubMed articles, clinical practice guidelines, drug interaction databases, medical textbooks, and real-time medical literature updates. The system employs advanced document processing pipelines that extract and normalize medical entities, ensuring consistent terminology across different knowledge sources and enabling precise semantic matching.

### Knowledge Base Management
The medical knowledge base is dynamically updated through multiple channels including automated PubMed API integration, clinical guideline repositories, and manual curation processes. The system implements version control for knowledge sources to track changes in medical recommendations and ensure users receive the most current information. Advanced indexing strategies optimize retrieval performance while maintaining medical accuracy and source attribution.

The knowledge base includes specialized sub-collections for different medical domains such as cardiology, oncology, pediatrics, and emergency medicine, allowing for domain-specific retrieval and response generation. Each knowledge source is tagged with metadata including publication date, author credentials, evidence level, and clinical relevance scores to enable intelligent source selection and ranking.

## Complete System Flow

### Phase 1: Enhanced User Input Processing and Medical Context Extraction
The system begins by receiving user input through multiple channels including text, voice, or image uploads with advanced medical entity recognition capabilities. The input is processed through a specialized medical NLP pipeline that identifies medical entities, extracts symptoms, medications, and conditions while determining the urgency level and medical complexity of the query. The system employs a hierarchical intent classification model specifically trained on medical terminology that can distinguish between general health questions, symptom descriptions, medication inquiries, and emergency situations.

For each identified intent, the system activates the appropriate specialized agent from its multi-agent framework while simultaneously extracting relevant medical context from the user's medical history, current medications, and previous interactions. These agents include a Symptom Analysis Agent, Medication Information Agent, Treatment Recommendation Agent, and Emergency Assessment Agent, each equipped with domain-specific RAG capabilities. The system also performs a comprehensive risk assessment using medical knowledge bases to determine if immediate escalation to human medical professionals is required based on symptom severity and medical complexity.

### Phase 2: Advanced RAG-Enhanced Information Retrieval and Medical Response Generation
Once the appropriate agent is activated, the system employs its enhanced RAG pipeline with multiple retrieval strategies to access the most relevant and current medical information. The RAG system queries multiple specialized knowledge bases including PubMed abstracts, clinical guidelines databases, drug interaction repositories, medical textbooks, and real-time medical literature updates. The retrieved information is processed through an advanced relevance scoring mechanism that considers medical domain expertise, publication recency, evidence levels, and clinical applicability to the user's specific medical context.

The agent then synthesizes the retrieved information with the user's medical context, conversation history, and relevant clinical guidelines to generate a comprehensive and medically accurate response. The response generation process includes multi-source fact-checking, medical accuracy validation against established clinical guidelines, and adaptive language complexity matching to the user's medical literacy level. The system also generates intelligent follow-up questions based on medical best practices and identified information gaps to gather additional context for more accurate assessments or recommendations.

### Phase 3: Intelligent Response Delivery and Medical Follow-up Management
The generated response is delivered to the user through their preferred communication channel with appropriate medical formatting, visual aids, and source citations when necessary. The system maintains a comprehensive conversation state that tracks the user's medical understanding, satisfaction levels, and any follow-up questions while continuously monitoring for medical escalation triggers. If the user requests clarification or additional information, the system can retrieve more specific medical details or activate different specialized agents with enhanced RAG capabilities.

The system continuously monitors the conversation for medical escalation indicators such as complex medical conditions, potential drug interactions, emergency symptoms, or situations requiring immediate medical attention. When such scenarios are detected, the system can seamlessly escalate the conversation to qualified medical professionals while providing them with a comprehensive medical summary including interaction history, identified symptoms, retrieved medical information, and recommended next steps based on clinical guidelines.
