# Bootcamp Structure: 4 Phases

The bootcamp is divided into four distinct phases, each focusing on a critical aspect of an end-to-end project:

---

## **Phase 1: Data Preprocessing**
- **Objective:** Prepare raw data for model building.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers).  
  - Feature engineering and extraction.  
  - Data transformation (scaling, encoding, etc.).  
  - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.  

**Deliverables:** Preprocessed data ready for modeling.

---

## **Phase 2: Model Building**
- **Objective:** Develop and evaluate machine learning models.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Build models for:  
    - Sentiment Analysis.  
    - Document Classification.  
    - BERT-based NLP tasks (fine-tuning and inference).  
  - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).  
  - Document insights and observations.  

**Deliverables:** Trained models with evaluation reports.

---

## **Phase 3: Streamlit UI Development**
- **Objective:** Create an interactive user interface to showcase project outputs.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Design a dashboard using Streamlit.  
  - Integrate model predictions into the UI.  
  - Add visualizations to display insights (charts, tables, metrics).  
  - Ensure a user-friendly experience.  

**Deliverables:** Functional Streamlit application with a live dashboard.

---

## **Phase 4: Deployment**
- **Objective:** Deploy the project for real-world use.  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Implement deployment on cloud platforms:  
    - AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, etc.).  
    - Azure (App Services, Functions, etc.).  
  - Ensure scalability and security of the deployment.  
  - Create a deployment guide and test the application in production.  

**Deliverables:** Deployed project accessible via cloud platforms.

---

## **Project Workflow and Progression**
- Participants must **complete each phase** sequentially and submit deliverables to move to the next phase.  
- **Phase Advancement Rule:** Only those who successfully complete **Phase 1** will proceed to **Phase 2**, and so on.

**Final Goal:** Deliver a fully functional, end-to-end project with preprocessing, modeling, UI, and deployment.
