## Abstract
The Multi-PDFs ChatApp AI Agent is an innovative, Streamlit-based web application designed to allow users to interactively chat with multiple PDF documents using advanced AI technologies. By leveraging **Langchain**, **Google Gemini Pro**, and **FAISS Vector DB**, this application enables efficient PDF document processing, text chunking, and conversational queries to generate accurate, context-aware responses in real-time.

The system extracts text from uploaded PDF files, processes the information into manageable chunks, and utilizes powerful language models to compare user queries with the text content. The chatbot delivers answers based on semantically similar sections of the PDFs. Key features include adaptive chunking, support for multi-document conversational queries, and compatibility with both PDF and TXT file formats. The application seamlessly integrates multiple large language models (LLMs), ensuring robust performance and high accuracy in document-related conversations.

This project demonstrates the use of cutting-edge AI techniques in real-world applications, offering users a simple yet powerful interface to engage with PDF content, transforming static documents into interactive, chat-enabled resources.
