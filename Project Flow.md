# Multi-PDFs ðŸ“š ChatApp AI Agent ðŸ¤–

## Abstract
The Multi-PDFs ChatApp AI Agent is a robust web application built using **React** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend, enabling users to interactively chat with multiple PDF documents using advanced AI technologies. By leveraging **Langchain**, **OpenAI models**, and **FAISS Vector DB**, this application enables efficient PDF document processing, text chunking, and conversational queries to generate accurate, context-aware responses in real-time.

The application allows users to upload multiple PDF files, extract text, and manage interactions through an intuitive React-based user interface. The backend, powered by Django, handles text extraction, chunk processing, and communication with AI models for generating responses. The system compares user queries with document content and delivers answers based on semantically similar sections of the PDFs. 

Key features include adaptive chunking for dynamic text management, multi-document conversational queries, and compatibility with both PDF and TXT file formats. With the integration of multiple **OpenAI** models, the app ensures high accuracy and fast performance, transforming static PDFs into interactive, chat-enabled resources for seamless document exploration.
