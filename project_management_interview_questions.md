# Data Science Project Manager Interview Questions

## 1. Project Understanding & Lifecycle
- Walk me through the typical lifecycle of a data science project you’ve managed.
- How do you define success metrics for a data science project?
- How do you handle scope creep in data science initiatives?

## 2. Team & Stakeholder Management
- How do you bridge communication gaps between data scientists and business stakeholders?
- How do you prioritize tasks when working with cross-functional teams?

## 3. Risk & Delivery
- How do you assess the feasibility of a data science solution before committing resources?
- Tell me about a time when a data science model failed in production. What was your role?

## 4. Tooling & Infrastructure Awareness
- What data platforms and tools have you worked with (e.g., Databricks, MLflow, Airflow)?
- How do you handle data privacy and compliance concerns in ML projects?

# Generative AI (GenAI) Project Manager Interview Questions

## 1. Strategy & Use Case Selection
- How do you identify appropriate business use cases for Generative AI?
- What framework do you use to evaluate the ROI of a GenAI project?

## 2. Ethics & Governance
- What are your views on hallucination in LLMs, and how do you mitigate them in production?
- How do you ensure GenAI applications comply with responsible AI principles?

## 3. Technical Collaboration
- How do you work with prompt engineers and fine-tuning teams?
- Have you deployed or integrated GenAI solutions (like GPT, Claude, Gemini) in business workflows?

## 4. Delivery & Scaling
- What’s the difference in managing traditional ML projects vs GenAI projects?
- How do you handle latency and cost concerns with large model inference in production?

# Agentic AI Project Manager Interview Questions

## 1. Project Conceptualization
- What is Agentic AI, and how is it different from traditional AI systems?
- Describe a project where you managed autonomous AI agents or multi-agent systems.

## 2. System Design Understanding
- How would you architect a solution using LLM-based agents (e.g., LangChain agents, AutoGPT)?
- How do you manage memory, planning, and tool-use in agentic systems?

## 3. Risk and Safety
- What failure modes are common in agentic AI systems, and how do you safeguard against them?
- How do you monitor and evaluate emergent behavior in autonomous agents?

## 4. Collaboration with Research & Engineering
- How do you balance innovation with stability in fast-moving domains like agentic AI?
- Describe how you handled a project where the technology stack or models evolved mid-project.

# Bonus: Cross-Domain Scenarios
- Suppose your team suggests using a GenAI solution to replace an existing rule-based system. How would you evaluate and transition?
- A client wants an autonomous sales agent. How would you scope, staff, and de-risk such a project?
